# C++ Theater Backend (part 3), FULL implementation

The final installment of this project involves using hashmaps, vectors, and UX flow concepts to build a CLI program that acts as a theater system backend with user and admin account(s) with different functions. Obviously since the information is unencrypted this isn't a great example of what should be done in the real world but is meant to showcase how far my C++ understanding has come since the first part of this project. 

Users can
		
	1. Reserve Seats
        2. View Orders
        3. Update Orders
        4. Display Receipt
        5. Log Out
	
And the Admin can 

	1. Print a report of all the auditoriums
	2. Logout
	3. Exit the program

A1, A2, and A3.txt contain the three auditoriums, and userdb.dat contains the account information.
